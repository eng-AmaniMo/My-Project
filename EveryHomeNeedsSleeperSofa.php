                So it’s no secret that we love furniture, but recently we were tasked with picking the one item that no home should ever be without. And while that’s basically as tough as deciding whether flats or heels are a more essential part of your shoe collection, we finally settled on the oh-so-reliable sleeper sofa.
                <br><br> 
                For starters, the sleeper sofa sort of allowed us to cheat since it’s two pieces of furniture in one, but that is precisely why it beat out some pretty steep competition (I mean, the dresser DOES store our favorite clothes, but we digress). Versatile, functional, and stylish—thanks to City Furniture’s incredible sleeper sofa selection—this all-in-one gem checks all the furniture boxes. It can turn an office into a guest room, turn a guest room back into a usable living space, and offers convenient solutions for one-bedroom and studio apartments.

                 Does it get any better than that? Actually, it does. Thanks to the recent addition of memory foam mattresses to our Kevin Charles line of sleeper sofas, this handy piece of furniture has achieved the impossible: it’s just as comfortable as your bed. Designed with five inches of state-of-the-art memory foam, these revolutionary mattresses offer pressure point relief and cradling comfort. In fact, the only flaw we can see is houseguests who may never want to leave.
